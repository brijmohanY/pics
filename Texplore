**Scene: Victor Office Lobby**

*Sam is setting up a poster for the hackathon. Alex walks by, notices the poster, and approaches Sam.*

**Alex:** (curious) Hey Sam, what’s this about a hackathon?

**Sam:** (excited) Oh, hey Alex! Yes, it’s our upcoming Hackathon on the 22nd and 23rd right here at the Victor office. It’s going to be epic!

**Alex:** (interested) Really? Tell me more! What’s the theme?

**Sam:** (grinning) We’ve got multiple themes this year! The best part? One idea from each theme will be awarded for Best Idea. And for the final round, 25 teams will be selected to compete, and the best 4 products will win huge prize money!

*Jamie walks in, overhearing the conversation.*

**Jamie:** (intrigued) Did I hear something about a hackathon and prize money?

**Sam:** (enthusiastic) You heard right, Jamie! Plus, there are goodies and tokens of appreciation for all participants. It’s going to be an amazing opportunity to showcase your skills and creativity.

**Alex:** (excited) That sounds fantastic! How do we participate?

**Sam:** (explaining) Teams can be 2 to 4 members. Just form a team, brainstorm some brilliant ideas, and submit your proposal by August 5th. Then, join us on the 22nd and 23rd for the hackathon.

**Jamie:** (thoughtful) I love a good challenge. What’s the process like after submission?

**Sam:** (confident) Once submissions are in, our panel will review them and select the top 25 teams for the final round. Those teams will get to develop their ideas over the two days of the hackathon. The best 4 products will be awarded the grand prizes.

**Alex:** (motivated) Sounds like a perfect chance to innovate and win big. I’m in!

**Jamie:** (excited) Me too! Let’s form a team, Alex. We can combine our skills and create something amazing.

**Sam:** (cheerful) That’s the spirit! I can’t wait to see what you come up with. Remember, it’s not just about winning. It’s about the experience, the learning, and the fun of creating something new.

**Alex:** (curious) Sam, what are some other benefits of participating in this hackathon?

**Sam:** (enthusiastic) Glad you asked, Alex! Here are some amazing benefits:
- You’ll get the chance to meet and interact with our leadership team.
- Network with some of the best coders at the India level.
- Gain invaluable experience working in a high-pressure, fast-paced environment.
- And let’s not forget, there are incredible prizes! Along with the grand prizes for the best 4 products, each participant will receive goodies and tokens of appreciation.

**Jamie:** (impressed) That’s awesome! Meeting the leadership and top coders sounds like a great opportunity for networking and learning.

**Alex:** (excited) And working in a pressure environment will really test and improve our skills.

**Jamie:** (determined) Let’s do this, Alex! Hackathon, here we come!
