Hello Ruta,

Following our recent meetings regarding the insurance PDF requirements, we have completed the analysis and initiated the implementation phase. Based on our current progress, we plan to deliver the insurance PDF task for User Acceptance Testing (UAT) on 22nd August 2024.

We are confident that this timeline will allow us to meet your expectations, but please let us know if you have any concerns or additional requirements. Your feedback is crucial to ensure that we address all aspects of the project effectively.

Best regards,

Current notification systems don’t include direct links or actions. Users receive updates but have to go to other places to access files or information, which is inconvenient and inefficient.

Also it doesn't not have email integration 

### Existing Solutions and Drawbacks

Current notification systems often don't include direct links or actionable items in their messages. Users get updates but have to go to different places to access related resources or download files. This extra step reduces efficiency and makes it harder for users to quickly get the information they need.


### Problem Statement:

**Background:**
Applications need efficient notification systems to inform users about events and asynchronous processes like data exports. Developing these systems in-house can be costly and complex.

**Problem:**
Creating a custom notification system involves high development costs and significant effort, including real-time updates and support for multiple channels, such as email. This complexity strains resources and increases development time.

**Solution:**
The Centralized Smart Notification Widget provides a plug-and-play solution for integrating notifications into applications. It handles real-time updates and asynchronous requests, including optional email alerts, simplifying implementation and reducing development costs.

**Background:**
Applications often require robust notification systems to keep users informed about various events and the status of asynchronous processes, such as data exports or other background tasks. Developing and implementing these systems from scratch can be complex and costly.

**Problem:**
Building a custom notification system involves significant development resources, including designing notification logic, creating user interfaces, ensuring real-time updates, and handling multiple notification channels. This process is resource-intensive and can be burdensome for development teams, especially when trying to support diverse notification needs, including real-time alerts and optional email notifications.

**Solution:**
The Centralized Smart Notification Widget addresses these challenges by offering a plug-and-play solution that integrates easily into various applications. It provides real-time notifications for both immediate events and asynchronous requests, such as data exports, and includes the option to send email notifications. By providing a pre-built, easy-to-integrate widget, it reduces the complexity and cost associated with developing a custom notification system, streamlining the implementation process and ensuring consistent and effective user communication.




### MVP: Centralized Smart Notification Widget

#### **Objective:**
Develop a plug-and-play MVP for the Centralized Smart Notification Widget to offer a cost-effective, efficient solution for integrating notifications into various applications. This widget will handle real-time notifications for both immediate events and asynchronous requests (e.g., data exports) and can optionally send email notifications if selected by the application. The goal is to simplify the implementation of notifications, reduce development costs, and ensure timely and consistent user communication.

#### **Core Features for MVP:**
1. **Event-Driven Notifications**:
   - **Basic Notifications**: Trigger notifications for predefined events like task completions or messages.
   - **Notification Types**: Include basic notifications such as pop-ups, toast messages, and optional email notifications.

2. **Async Requests**:
   - **Request Notifications**: Inform users about the status of asynchronous requests, including exports and other background processes.
   - **Download Links**: Provide direct links or status updates for async requests within the notifications.

3. **Email Notifications**:
   - **Optional Emails**: Send notifications via email if configured by the application.

4. **User Preferences**:
   - **Basic Controls**: Allow users to enable or disable notifications through a simple settings interface.

5. **Plug-and-Play Integration**:
   - **Easy Integration**: Offer clear documentation and a straightforward setup process for integrating the widget into various applications.

6. **Multi-Platform Support**:
   - **Web Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with web applications.

#### **Tech Stack for MVP:**
1. **Frontend**:
   - **React**: For building the widget's user interface.
   - **CSS**: For basic styling and layout.

2. **Backend**:
   - **Node.js with Express**: For managing notification logic and API interactions.
   - **WebSocket**: For real-time notification delivery.
   - **Email Service**: Integration with an email service like SendGrid or Mailgun for sending email notifications.

3. **Database**:
   - **MongoDB**: For storing user preferences and notification logs.

4. **Authentication**:
   - **JWT**: For basic authentication and session management.

5. **Hosting**:
   - **Heroku**: For deploying and scaling the widget.

6. **Integration**:
   - **RESTful API**: For integration with external applications, supporting endpoints for notifications and async requests.

#### **Implementation Steps:**
1. **Define MVP Scope**: Document core features and functionalities.
2. **Design UI/UX**: Create wireframes and mockups for the widget’s interface.
3. **Develop Frontend**: Build the UI using React and apply styling with CSS.
4. **Set Up Backend**: Develop the backend with Node.js and Express for managing notifications and API interactions.
5. **Integrate Database**: Use MongoDB for managing user preferences and notification history.
6. **Implement Notification Logic**: Code the functionality for triggering and displaying notifications.
7. **Handle Async Requests**: Implement features to notify users of async request statuses and provide updates or download links.
8. **Email Notification Integration**: Set up email service integration to send notifications via email if configured.
9. **Create Plug-and-Play Setup**: Develop documentation and a simple integration guide for other applications.
10. **Test**: Conduct testing to ensure core features function correctly, including email notifications.
11. **Deploy**: Launch the widget on Heroku and test its integration with a sample application.
12. **Monitor and Iterate**: Gather feedback and make necessary improvements.

This MVP will deliver essential notification and async request management features, including optional email notifications, streamlining integration, and reducing development effort while ensuring effective user communication.
