### Simple Task Tracker

#### **Problem Statement:**
In many organizations and personal projects, managing tasks effectively is a common challenge. Without a dedicated system, tasks can be easily forgotten, missed, or poorly prioritized, leading to decreased productivity and missed deadlines. Traditional methods like sticky notes, emails, or spreadsheets are often inefficient and lack the features necessary for effective task management.

Additionally, users need to manage deadlines for upcoming trainings, track Jira tasks, monitor the time spent on each task, and categorize tasks for better organization. These functionalities are crucial for ensuring that all responsibilities are managed efficiently and time is utilized effectively.

#### **Solution:**
A Simple Task Tracker is a lightweight, web-based application designed to help individuals and teams manage their tasks efficiently. The application provides features such as task creation, status tracking, due dates, categorization, and prioritization to streamline task management and enhance productivity. It also includes the ability to add deadlines for upcoming trainings, track Jira tasks, and monitor time spent on each task.

#### **Key Features:**
1. **Task Creation**: Users can create new tasks with details such as title, description, due date, and priority level.
2. **Status Tracking**: Tasks can be marked as pending, in progress, or completed, allowing users to track the progress of their tasks.
3. **Due Dates**: Users can set due dates for tasks to ensure timely completion.
4. **Priority Levels**: Tasks can be assigned priority levels (e.g., low, medium, high) to help users focus on the most critical tasks first.
5. **Task Filtering**: Users can filter tasks by status, due date, and priority to quickly find and manage their tasks.
6. **Training Deadlines**: Users can add and track deadlines for upcoming trainings, ensuring they meet their learning goals on time.
7. **Jira Task Integration**: Users can link and manage their Jira tasks within the task tracker, consolidating all their responsibilities in one place.
8. **Time Tracking**: Users can log and monitor the time spent on each task, helping them manage their time more effectively.
9. **Categorization**: Users can categorize tasks into different groups (e.g., work, personal, training) for better organization and easier retrieval.
10. **Responsive Design**: The application is accessible from any device, ensuring users can manage their tasks on the go.

#### **Benefits of Implementing the Solution:**
1. **Improved Organization**: A dedicated task tracker helps users organize their tasks in one place, reducing the risk of tasks being forgotten or missed.
